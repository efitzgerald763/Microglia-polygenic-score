This repository contains code for the analyses contained in Fitzgerald et al 2024, Brain Behaviour and Immunity. We created a genetic score to infer microglial function in large cohorts of individuals. Using this score, we show that microglial function contributes to sex-dependent risk through an interaction with enviromental risk factors at multiple life stages.
